## Tentative files configuration for User

### Files Gradle

* build.gradle has the configuration of gradle for user.
* gradle.properties has values that build.gradle will use.
* credentials.dat has all credentials to use.

##### build.gradle
```groovy
   buildscript {
       repositories {
           mavenCentral()
           maven {
                url "https://dl.bintray.com/fundacionjala/enforce"
           }
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'org.fundacionjala.gradle.plugins.enforce:enforce-gradle-plugin:1.0.1'
       }
   }

   apply plugin: 'enforce'

   enforce {
       srcPath = 'src'
   }
```

#####  gradle.properties

```groovy
    credentialId=myCustomId
```

#####  credentials.dat

```json
{
 "default": {
        "username": "user@org.com",
        "password": "mypassword",
        "token": "2B9UvHKK2E1ky1EkkYBPFvbLM",
        "sfdcType" : "login",
        "type": "ecrypted"
    }
}
```

<h3> <strong>Setup Salesforce organization credentials </strong></h3>

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Credential support</h5>
  <p>Managing of credentials can create and update credentials in 'credentials.dat' file which is located  in HOME directory. A format was shown in Files gradle that is on the  last point.</p>
  <p>'AddCredential task' creates a credential in 'credentials.dat' file located in HOME directory it is saved as encrypted by default and its 'sfdcType' field is saved with a default login value. </p>
  <p>'UpdateCredential task ' updates a credential by key from 'credentials.dat' file.</p>
</div>

> **Note:** Notice that the example uses the “default” key which by convention is the one to be used by default when a task is executed. You can have several entries to different salesforce accounts but each entry needs to have an unique key.
